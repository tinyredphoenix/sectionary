income-tax if this Part had been in force from the date of the institution of the fund, without regard to anytax which may have been paid on any sum, and such agg reg ate (if any) shall be deemed to be income
received by the employee in the previous year in which the recognition of the fund takes effect and shall be
included in the employee's total income for that prev ious year, and, for the purposes of assessment, the
remainder of the transferred balance shall be disregarde d, but no other exemption or  relief, by way of refund
